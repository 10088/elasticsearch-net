Maybe even more legit, if you put in the work to look super stodgy.<p>The odd thing is everybody knows all of the YC companies are run by \"dogs,\" and that's where the fun is. In fact, I'd say the human interest story of college kids making millions from only $20k of funding is the biggest selling point for a lot of the YCombinator companies. Not to demean their products, but I can't remember the last time my mom got excited about, say, her Oracle online calendar. On the other hand, Kiko's a really interesting story.<p>All of this leads me to believe that simply being a part of YCombinator alleviates suspicion of all of the bad aspects of being a dog (lack of credibility, obvious inexperience, youthful stupidity) and also exposes all of the good aspects (mostly, the publicity, and perhaps the fact that you're more in touch with what's new and hot). <p>In the end, I think this is a net win for folks like me. To what I think will be a large extent, companies doing something obviously YCombinator-like will catch all of the YC benefits simply by association. I wonder, though, if companies that are branching out into new areas who can't manage YCombinator-style support will still have to struggle with being taken seriously. <p>And I still find it ironic that PG's the main reason something he's said previously is being proved irrelevant.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html\">http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html\">http://www.unc.edu/depts/jomc/academics/dri/idog.html</a></font>","meta":{"points":8,"type":0,"created":"2007-04-13T22:59:51.85","commentsCount":0}}

On the other hand, that entitlement feeling isn't present if you apply to a college and get denied. This is because in admissions there are a limited number of seats available and a cutoff point at which no more people can be accepted. Like in the olympic tryouts - the top X% of swimmers for a country may get to go to the games, but those below that threshold don't get to go. It's not much different in getting funding - you can just slide off the edge and just not make the 'admission'. When I was rejected by Harvard I thought I sucked. Now I see it as laughable. Have you ever been to the admissions office? A rejection in an admissions scenario is not necessarily a reflection on you. At YCombinator we go through and rank all of the applications, then we take the top 30 for interviews. Recently we looked at some of our early teams and compared how they are doing now with how we rated them in the application process. It was scary! One of our most successful teams was at number 30!

Here's a little about what I'm doing.<p>I've worked in the video game industry for the last two years, and I've been messing around with Direct3D/OpenGL for about 5.  I believe wrapping these API's in an extremely high level language like Lisp might speed up creation of a video game by about an order of magnitude, especially if I expose only very high level graphical concepts to Lisp, instead of just exposing every API function.<p>Speed is crucial.  I've layered Ruby onto my engine, but the problem was that if I wanted 60 frames per second, I could only do 16,000 Ruby if-statements per frame.  That wouldn't work at all.<p>Even if the high level language I choose is only 4-10 times slower than C++, that would be fine.  Ruby was about 100-200 times slower.<p>Investigating Lisp, I only require two things:<p>1) Somehow, I expose C functions to Lisp.  These functions take standard types as arguments (float, int, double, char ...).<p>For example, I might expose, from C:<p>(Edit: argh, I can't write a star on News.YC.

I won't get into the boring details, but I'm distributing the Lisp script files for anyone to edit and run on other's machines, so sandboxing Lisp somehow is also pretty crucial.  As long as under no circumstances can Lisp access the file system, then everything else is fine.<p>Thanks everyone!\nShawn\n</font>","meta":{"points":3,"type":0,"created":"2007-04-13T22:59:42.47","commentsCount":0}}

Tuned Lisp code can be as fast as C, but you have to know the compiler so intimately that you can tell what kind of machine insturctions it is generating; you'll use \"disassemble\" a lot (\"disassemble\" is a part of CommonLisp standard---you may get a sense how Lispers are performance freak).  Usually the bottleneck part is tuned to the point that it won't do any allocation and run-time type dispatch at all.<p>There's one big advantage of using Lisp over C for performance: Macros.  During optimization it is typical that you have to write several versions of code, changing bits and pieces, and run benchmarks to see what is optimal.  Macros allow you to generate different versions of code from simple changes of parameters, without incurring overhead of function call/variable reference etc.  (You can do similar thing in C++ templates, but Lisp macros allows much more).  If you can easily parameterize your code, you can try more ideas and run more benchmarks, so it is more likely that you'll find better optimization.<p>AN example: Allegro CL version 7 and later has Perl-compatible regular expression library, purely written in Lisp, that runs faster than Perl (at least at the moment I wrote it, using benchmark suite came with PCRE).\n</font>","meta":{"points":2,"type":0,"created":"2007-04-14T22:59:42.93","commentsCount":0}}

{"id":12834,"parentId":0,"text":"<font >I'm half asleep right now..<p>The word on the street is that adventure games are the next big thing in casual games.  Not sudoku, or bejeweled.  Casual gamers expect more these days.  Adventure games are also much harder and take much more time to clone.  Finally, you could sell level packs to your customers once your actual product is done, something that you can't do for games with random levels.  I think between your web site and the main portals (RealArcade, BigFishGames, Oberon) and your own web site you can start your own niche.  Just make sure you can partner with somebody who can create great art, quickly.  However, the kind of companies PG wants for YC are ones that can have a reasonable demo after just three months of work, and also those that he knows enough about that he can actually contribute to.  In other words, there are millions of things in the digital world one could make money off, but PG (like everybody else) is interested in a subset of them, and no investor who wants to be involved with a project will choose one where you'll be in the corner working on your own thing and he will only play a small role in the fun.  (I wouldn't be surprised if helping startups from scratch IS like an adventure game to PG.)<p>And, actually, Yahoo! could actually buy you considering they are one of the top places for selling casual games.  BigFishGames bought a developer in Europe after he came out with 2 or 3 hit games within 1 year, and called it BigFishGames Europe.  In other words, the portals are buying developers who can actually create a quality game on a low budget, quickly and repeatedly.  When they own the developer, they can put it on the front page and make a lot more profit, such as BigFishGames is doing with their Mystery series of games.  But, some people have made a decent living (not millionaires, but livable).<p>If you want to create adventure games that use the mouse that are easy to get into and want to make about $8-$10 per sale on the portals and about $18 on your web site, go for it.  Those are the kinds of games that people want which are also hard to clone, and hard to find a free flash game online to replace.  You also have the advantage of creating some IP (character, names, trademarks) to use later, which is hard to do if you're just creating Bejeweled (and for which games will easily find flash games if they don't want to pay for the real versions.)<p>So, go for it, as long as you are focusing on creating an actual game as soon as possible, and not spending the next 10 months developing a framework for your future game, because that is pointless.  Aveyond is not an adventure game but more like an RPG, but it was a good seller (supposedly) and made in Game Maker (which also supports old-school one-screen-at-a-time adventure games.)  Just create some kind of an adventure game where you own the IP using Game Maker, then after you are a big success you can port it to XBOX 360 or the Mac.  The key is to create a game, not a game framework.</font>","meta":{"points":1,"type":0,"created":"2007-04-14T22:59:45.693","commentsCount":0}}

People who have ambitions beyond ~40K typically either move or start their own business(es).  More than half the people I know run a one-person business either on the side or instead of having a \"job\".<p>There are a coupla barriers to moving; we have a house to pay for, hardly know anyone (personally) who doesn't live around here, and have issues \"getting a decent salary\" due to history.   I've been freelancing for seven years, with no degree, and it turns out that people aren't interested in hiring someone like that remotely.  <p>In 2003, we gave moving to the Boston area a shot (Nashua), but the only position I managed to get was Comcast tech support (and all our clients were down here, of course), which didn't pay enough to save up enough money for a deposit.  It was a totally different world up there.  Here, if you have a thousand dollars, you can pay a deposit and the first two months rent, and have plenty left over to look for a job for a month.  Your first full paycheck at even a convenience store would pay the rent.  In Nashua, I was making (for the 6 months we were there) about the same amount I would here for the same job, except that landlords wanted outrageous sums for housing that even slumlords would be ashamed of in the South.  \"Let me get this straight: you want nearly a thousand a month for a room that doesn't even have a private bath?!  Did you accidentally include an extra zero?\"<p>Anyway, enough ranting. :)  If you've lived in such a place long enough to think it's normal to pay thousands a month, rather than hundreds, just to have food, gas, and a small house, I imagine it's hard to understand the shock.  Six months into that attempted move, after being too exhausted from dealing with people all day (I'm not a people person) to do anything but collapse into bed, it finally became clear that there was essentially no way we would ever be able to save up enough money (we had to stay in weekly places, due to never having the 2K or so it would have required to get a crappy apartment).  We'd been spoiled by doing exactly this same thing in 1998 moving to Florida, and having that turn out well.  <p>So, basically, the biggest barrier is that it would take years of saving, here, to come up with enough money to not instantly be homeless in the Boston area or SV.  Alternatively, we can just continue with doing startups in extremelycheapland, while living a middle class lifestyle on 15 hours of freelancing a week.\n</font>","meta":{"points":1,"type":0,"created":"2007-04-14T22:59:45.97","commentsCount":0}}

I agree that the biggest procrastination inducing disincentive to <i>starting</i> creative work is the preconception in the creator's mind that \"this will be a great thing - I will make it perfect\", etc.  I learned while designing in architectural school that the key to good design was to strip away all preconceptions about a problem before starting - which is dramatically harder than it sounds.  The preconception of a quest for perfection before starting is the most important one.<p>However, once you have \"programmed\" your conscious mind with the problem, allowed your subconscious to crunch on it and give you the first draft of a solution to the problem, the quest for making it as good as possible is key to actually having it be good.  With that first solution, you can then refine it, with the idea of making it increasingly better. The question then is when do you stop (or go live) - a very important point.   The beauty of web development is that you can think of the project as an evolution toward being very good from somewhat humble beginnings.  This makes it that much easier to come to the good-enough point faster than in the past stand-alone application days, but then continue improving as long as the project continues to be exciting.

{"id":13000,"parentId":0,"text":"<font >Learn to program.  ;-)<p>Seriously, there are a bunch of reasons why coders turn down a startup:<p>1.) Not enough compensation.  If you're paying them cash, you have to pay them market rates.  For a bright but junior programmer, that's minimum $55-60K/year. salary in most of the tech hotspots.  For someone experienced, figure at least $100k/year.  If you're looking for hourly contractors, expect to pay at least $75/hour for anyone decent.  If you give them equity - well, I personally would not join a startup for less than 20% equity, and I suspect many other technical founders have similar minimums.  Actually, the only reason my current startup got away with so little (I'm getting 25%) is because it has 5 founders, and nobody else has more than 25%.<p>2.) Boring idea.  Good programmers like to work on interesting problems.  I joined my startup because it was in a problem domain that I waste a lot of time in anyways, I knew the area, and it'd let me try some cool stuff that I didn't know if I could do, but it'd be fun as hell to try.<p>3.) They don't trust you.  Techies have a natural aversion to business-type people.  Be straight with them, always.  The second they think you're trying to bullshit them, they'll walk away.<p>4.) They don't think you add much value.  Ultimately, it'll be the techie building the product.  They need a reason why working with you beats building the product on your own.  Usually, your best bet is to have a large personal network, or good people skills, or the ability to sell something.  I don't think it's necessarily true that techies can't be good with people, but in my experience, I can't code <i>and</i> be good with people at the same time, so have a cofounder with people skills has been a big win for me.<p>Remember, if you're founding a technical startup, you want the best coder you can find.  He'll usually be young, because good experienced coders typically have families and will not work for stock, and you generally can't afford the $150K/year that they'll cost you.  <i>Don't</i> try to skimp and get cheaper labor - lots of companies tried that in the dot-com bomb (notably Value America), and they almost universally went out of business.  Average coders cannot hit the high notes; you need to hit the high notes as a startup, because all of the middle ground is taken.<p>In my case, I met my cofounder at Homecoming.  We'd lived across the hall from me sophomore year, so I went over to talk to him and see what he was doing.  Turned out he was working on a startup in a field I was interested in.  He introduced me to the other cofounders afterwards (2 of which I already knew from college).  I didn't actually join until several months later, when their initial choice for a technical founder quit, but he kept my name in mind.  </font>","meta":{"points":11,"type":0,"created":"2007-04-14T23:02:18.003","commentsCount":0}}

{"id":13001,"parentId":0,"text":"<font >If you're running a web based business (eg: not a retailer, but where everything is an online service) then the domicile of the business is the web, not any nationality.  In other words, you can incorporate anywhere you wish and its legitimate- the act of incorporation creates the domicile for the business. <p>If you're going to do business in Japan to the point that you have above ground employees (taxes, social security, etc.) then you'll have to find out the Japanese laws. Even then it probably makes sense to incorporate outside of Japan for tax reasons.   A foriegn corporation operating in a country is generaly treated differently (and better) than a domestic corporation.<p>But, if not, then you can incorporate in any jurisdiction which is friendly to corporations.<p>I would strongly recommend you do not incorporate in the US.  The USA is not a friendly jurisdiction for corporations and all the trends are that it is getting worse.  Ths US has enacted currency controls, limiting ones ability to move money in and out of the country-- this is the first step in the creation of an \"iron curtain\".  (Requiring passports of people who travel, as the US started doing in January is the second step.) <p>It is only appropriate to incorporate in america if your business is completely located in america.  (If you want to find out what your government does all day, just file business papers in many states- over the next 6 weeks you'll get contacted by many dozens of different agencies, all of whom want you to do paperwork and give them money. Texas is an exeption to this, Nevada may be as well.) <p>Ok, on to the real advice-- look at countries that are pro-business, or who are, or used to be tax havens.  The caymen islands and bahamas are obvious choices, but also st kitts and nevis are worth checking out.  You can legally incorporate there.  Some of these islands have restrictions about the business you can operate there, but are happy to incorporate foriegn businesses (that is to say, its easier if you'll not be opening an office on their soil).<p>Along those lines- ex UK protectorates, consider the Isle of Man (or is it the Isle of Wight?) and closer to home, New Zealand and Australia.  These latter two are high tax states, but are closer and may prove to be good choices for you. <p>Also consider the united arab emerites, monaco and Mauritius.  These are a different style, but they may prove to be good places.<p>Finally, probably the best place to incorporate is Panama.  Their government is oriented around providing services to foriegn industry... starting with the canal, but also ships registry, bank registration, incorporation and trust services, etc.  This is probably one of the easiest places to do it.<p>If you're planning to bank outside of Japan, you might consider incorporating in Switzerland, so that your corporation and your bank can have closer ties.  But I haven't looked into that much. <p>Its hard to find good information on this subject, probably because US courts have thrown people in jail for giving \"Advice on how to avoid US taxes\"... so, while this isn't a tax dodge (you're not a US citizen) people are wary of talking about it.<p></font>","meta":{"points":3,"type":0,"created":"2007-05-04T21:55:40.443","commentsCount":0}}

Microsoft's software is unmaintainable, without throwing titanic amounts of money at it. This means that if Microsoft experiences declining sales on its basic products (Windows, Office), the products themselves will disappear. In a decade, Wine may be all that is left of Windows.<p>2. The price of Windows is increasing, as the price of computers is plummeting. A $2000 computer with a $100 operating system works. A $500 computer with a $200 operating system doesn't. Windows should cost no more than $20 today. Microsoft's model is clearly unsustainable.<p>3. The biggest benefit from Microsoft alternatives isn't replacing Windows, the benefit is being able to do things that were never possible with Windows. Linux bootable CD/flash is a wonderful approach for single-purpose devices, which is what most of the world wants almost all computers to be.<p>I've been programming computers for 40 years now, and this is about the third major transition I've been through.

If someone is going to buy something that I've put my heart into, they're going to have to either pay me enough that I'll never have to worry about money again, or ensure that I'll get to see my vision through. The Dodgeball guys didn't get either of those.<p>For an example of a situation that I'd like to be in, look at Thawte. By selling it, Mark Shuttleworth got enough money that he could do things he was passionate about but might not be profitable in the near future, like paying people to write open source software. For me, it would be investing my time and money in the education of others to make sure more people could reach their full potential.<p>So if someone swindled me out of a business I wanted to see actually change the world in exchange for a couple of million dollars and the expectation that I'd be able to keep developing that business, I'd be pissed.

{"id":13288,"parentId":0,"text":"<font >(The office was finished early this year)<p>Here are some of the ideas I was working with specifically for making developer work spaces (This space is for a very fast growing but financially mature business - not a cash-strapped startup.  My primary advice for a startup office space: buy DOORS for desks!.  You can get doors at home depot for desks - hollow core nice wood without the door handles drilled out for just over $10 apiece.  Put the doors on top of file cabinets, and voila, you have a nice looking desk at very low cost that can last for years if you like.):<p>From the hackers perspective:<p>+Each space had to have natural light and views, but be closable for privacy.  The point here is to allow for staring into the distance when the subconscious is cranking on an idea, allow the space to be closed during moments of extreme focus, and to have the doors be a sign to others which mode the person is in at the time.<p>+Each space had to allow for a small conference of 2-3 people for easy and impromptu discussions.<p>+Each space had to have a lot of attention to detail and materials to make the spaces feel personal.<p>+There had to be a space for larger meeting outside of the formal business conference room.  I turned the lunch-room into one of the key design spaces and put whiteboards all along one wall with data ports for easy discussions and to make having lunch more fun.  (The company provides free lunch every day)<p>+The developer area had to be acoustically protected from the back office area, the customer relations area and the accounting area to avoid concentration disruptions.<p>+The space was in a classic old building with exposed wood beams and ceilings, so we used a raised floor system (with no sign to the user that it's raised) to have all the heating/cooling provided from the floor and allow for easy addition and movement of data and power ports.<p>+The server room was treated as a \"jewel\" with wall to wall glass for people (especially hackers) to appreciate the racks of technology at their fingertips.  (Also, the servers had multiple power back up systems including generators, a fire suppression system that would not damage the equipment in case it was used, and its own cooling system to run at ideal temperatures with a lot of extra rack space to allow for easy growth.)<p>From Management's Perspective:<p>+The space had to be flexible to allow for reconfiguration and potentially moving out to another space in the future.<p></font>","meta":{"points":2,"type":0,"created":"2007-04-16T23:03:21.997","commentsCount":0}}

You want to put yourself in positions where you have the leverage.\"  For example, if you apply to a college, and thousands of applicants are just like you, then you don't have leverage.<p>Your examples just ignore the fact that people get rejected from about 4 colleges a year, while they have a chance to correct their tests and homeworks about 1,000 times a semester.<p>This means that the numbers simply don't match up.  If you appealed 1,000 college decisions, you would have a great chance to get into a lot of them.  If you appealed 1,000 questions on a homework to one busy and egotistical professor, they would likely start avoiding you after the 10th question.<p>Therefore, people SHOULD appeal everything they want to, whether the judgement is specifically about them or not.<p>I saw that this was written originally as a post to a question about YC decisions.

These transplanted stem cells will create HIV immune T cells. Once there are enough immune T cells, the patient will probably still have HIV, but it will not develop into AIDS.

Furthermore, since the body does produce antibodies to HIV, these modified T cells may even be able to fight off the HIV.<p>To test this, we would get a mouse line, which are genetically very similar to each other from inbreeding so we won't have to worry about rejection of the transplants, and introduce the human CCR5 receptor into them. This, in theory, will allow the mice to be infected with HIV since HIV attaches to the CCR 5 receptor to enter and infect the cell. If this works, we can then try the technique of taking some of their stem cells, introducing the mutation, transplanting them back in, and see if their T cell count increases or if the levels of HIV decrease.

{"id":13578,"parentId":0,"text":"<font >iTunes is more about dealmaking and vendor lock-in than it is about technology or tools. I mean, it's just a file-downloading and hard-disk-access tool, plus a DRM system, plus a nice UI. People were downloading files and accessing hard disks and writing UI's in 1970; maybe they didn't have DRM, but that's hardly an advance. No, the reason iTunes is popular is because a) the iPod is popular, and the iPod only works (well) with iTunes; and b) Apple has made big deals with big record companies to put tons of songs on iTunes. iTunes is not a technological step up; it's just a parlaying of Apple's muscle and hardware marketshare. <p>So, even before iTunes existed, you'd probably have difficulty starting a startup which was supposed to do what iTunes does now, since without the iPod and Apple's negotiating power, you're left with a file downloading utility with DRM and no songs from major records, and nobody wants that. So iTunes not only isn't a tool, it isn't a startup-applicable idea; nobody would shy away from doing iTunes because it's a non-social-network application, because they wouldn't try to do iTunes to begin with. <p>Edit: Anyway, I think it's reasonable to think that a lot of the obvious straight-web-tools genres are well-done enough already that you'd have difficulty starting a startup in one. There might be whole new markets for straight tools out there for the taking, but they're at the very least harder to think of than they were in 1995. A lot of the equivalently easy-to-think-of social applications are just now getting off the ground, so the whole essay kind of makes sense. <p>The most interesting thing about the article to me is that it seems to imply a theory of waves of market gaps closing, and that maybe each market gap gets created by the closing of the one before it. There was a market gap for PCs, then that got (more or less) filled, which created a market gap for connectivity, the filling of which created a market gap for web tools, and now that closing has created a market gap for social tools. It could be totally bunk, but it's fun to think about anyway. </font>","meta":{"points":1,"type":0,"created":"2007-04-17T23:06:08.267","commentsCount":0}}

The hex-encoded version in this thread can be run to get the verbatim script.<p>wget -qO - <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/leaders\">http://news.ycombinator.com/leaders</a> |<p>First, we get the source of the leaders web page with wget.<p>tr '\"' '\\n\\n' |<p>Because that has very long lines, and it's easier to pluck at most one user id per line, transliterate double-quote and greater-than sign characters into newlines.<p>sed -n 's/^user?id=//p' |<p>This then allows sed to only print lines that begin with /user?id=/ after deleting that same text, resulting in a list of user ids, one per line.<p>xargs -ri wget -qO - '<a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id={}'\">http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id={}'</a> |<p>xargs takes each of these user ids in turn and runs a wget to fetch the \"submitted\" web page for that user id.  All the web pages' HTML goes down the same pipe, concatenated together.<p>tr '' '\\n' |<p>Again, we transliterate greater-than signs to split long lines at a convenient place.<p>sed -n 's/^\\([0-9][0-9]<i>\\) points</i> by .<i>=\\(.</i>\\).$/\\2 \\1/p' |<p>And sed gets used to filter out lines detailing the points scored by a user for a post, re-formating the information on the way, e.g. \"42 points by ...id=ralph\" becomes \"ralph 42\".  There's one line containing user id and score for each of the scores listed on the one web page.<p>awk '{c[$1]++; s[$1] += $2}\n    END {for (n in c) printf \"%-20s %5d %5d %7.2f\\n\", n, c[n], s[n], s[n] / c[n]}' |<p>All these (user id, score) tuples get fed to awk.  It uses two associative arrays, AKA dicts or hashes, to build up information for each line it reads.  Both arrays are indexed by user id;  \"$1\" in awk refers to the first word of the input line.  Array \"c\" maintains a count of the number of times a user id is seen.  Array \"s\" accumulates the scores for each user id.  Then at the end of all the input we loop through each index of \"c\", i.e. the user ids that have been seen, printing the user id, the frequency of that id, the sum of its scores, and the mean.<p>sort +3nr<p>These columns are given to sort which is told to sort on the fourth column, i.e. mean, numerically, in reverse.  My sort(1) doesn't give the warning yours does, but you're right;  I'm using old-school syntax that is deprecated but my fingers know how to type it.  :-)<p>Cheers, Ralph.</font>","meta":{"points":1,"type":0,"created":"2007-04-17T23:03:35.03","commentsCount":0}}

Indeed, in many ways the transitions saw a decrease in certain kinds of complexity.  Harmonic rhythm, that is the speed at which the underlying chord pattern changes, slowed down during the late 18th century.  Tuning shifted from meantone to equal temperament.  (More complex to implement, but results in a cleaner+simpler UI for musicians ;)<p>Also, there were advances in instrument design.  In particular, the piano of the 19th century was much like a modern piano.  Compared to the 18th century piano, it had a much more expressive power.  Bach for example really could not write crescendos into his keyboard music.  The keyboards of the time didn't do dynamics very well.  He had organs and harpsichords and clavicords and such.  In contrast, Brahms had the modern Piano.<p></font>","meta":{"username":"veritas","points":1,"type":1,"created":"2007-04-17T23:06:51.093","commentsCount":0}}
