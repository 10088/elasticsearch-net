== NEST Breaking Changes 

This lists *all* the binary breaking changes in NEST from 5.x ({github}/tree/e8013698ab5e4fec1b310ecd724f66f472746fed[last commit in 5.x at time of 6.0.0 GA release]) to 6.x ({github}/tree/6.0.0[6.0.0 GA release]). The intention in providing such a large list
is to allow you to quickly and easily search the changes between the two major versions, to understand what has been removed and 
equally importantly, what has been added.

Oh my goodness, this looks like a lot of breaking changes! In a lot of cases however, 
changes will not necessarily equate to compiler errors and therefore no action would be required on upgrade.

[float]
=== Nullable types 

Many of the +*Descriptor+ fluent methods accepted a value type as a parameter to set a property on a request.
These parameter types are now nullable value types to make working with the fluent API easier.

While technically this is a binary breaking change, it is not a change
you will hit during upgrade compilation. They are included here for completeness. 

[float]
=== Routing 
 
Various places that use to take a `string` for routing now take a `Routing` type.
An instance of `string` is implicitly convertible to an instance of `Routing`, so should not 
be an issue during upgrade.
 
[float] 
=== Fields 
 
Various places that took fields as a `string[]` now explicitly accept a `Fields` instance. 
This comes from improvements in the generator. 

[float]
=== Cat APIs 

The generated methods for `_cat` related APIs had their `H`, `S`, `V` and `Ts` methods renamed to 
a more descriptive variants. For example, `V` is now `Verbose`.
