[[delete-mapping]]
== Delete Mapping

Allows you to delete a mapping (type) along with its data. The REST endpoint is `/{index}/{type}` with `DELETE` method.

NOTE: Most times, it make more sense to reindex the data into a fresh index compared to deleting large chunks of it.

=== Examples

Using the default index and the inferred type name

[source,csharp]
----
this.ConnectedClient.DeleteMapping<ElasticSearchProject>()
----

or more explictly

[source,csharp]
----
this.ConnectedClient.DeleteMapping<ElasticSearchProject>("alternateindex","alternatetypename")
----
