== Snapshot

The gateway snapshot API allows to explicitly perform a snapshot through the 
gateway of one or more indices (backup them). By default, each index gateway periodically snapshot changes, 
though it can be disabled and be controlled completely through this API.

NOTEL this API only applies when using shared storage gateway implementation, and does not apply when using the (default) local gateway.
