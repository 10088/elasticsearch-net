== Delete Index

The delete index API allows you to delete an existing index.

The delete index API can also be applied to more than one index, or on `_all` indices (be careful!). 
All indices will also be deleted when no specific index is provided. 
In order to disable allowing to delete all indices, set `action.disable_delete_all_indices` setting in the config to `true`.
