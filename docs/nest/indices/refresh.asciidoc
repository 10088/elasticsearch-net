== Refresh

The refresh API allows to explicitly refresh one or more index, making all operations performed 
since the last refresh available for search. The (near) real-time capabilities depends on the 
index engine used. For example, the robin one requires refresh to be called, but by default a refresh is scheduled periodically.
