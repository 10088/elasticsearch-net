The aggregations framework helps provide aggregated data based on a search query. 
It is based on simple building blocks called aggregations, that can be composed in order 
to build complex summaries of the data.

Check out how to <<handling-aggregations,handle aggregations with NEST>> and take a look at the Aggegrations available

* <<avg-aggregation, Avg>>

* <<cardinality-aggregation, Cardinality>>

* <<date-histogram-aggregation, Date Histogram>>

* <<date-range-aggregation, Date Range>>

* <<extended-stats-aggregation, Extended Stats>>

* <<filter-aggregation, Filter>>

* <<geo-distance-aggregation, Geo Distance>>

* <<geohash-grid-aggregation, Geohash Grid>>

* <<global-aggregation, Global>>

* <<histogram-aggregation, Histogram>>

* <<ipv4-range-aggregation, IPv4 Range>>

* <<max-aggregation, Max>>

* <<min-aggregation, Min>>

* <<missing-aggregation, Missing>>

* <<percentiles-aggregation, Percentiles>>

* <<percentile-ranks-aggregation, Percentile Ranks>>

* <<range-aggregation, Range>>
