== Top Hits aggregation

A top hits metric aggregation keeps track of the most relevant document being aggregated. 
This aggregator is intended to be used as a sub aggregator, 
so that the top matching documents can be aggregated per bucket.

The top hits aggregation can effectively be used to group result sets by certain fields 
via a bucket aggregation. One or more bucket aggregations determines by which properties a result set get sliced into.
