A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating from buckets on parent document types to buckets on child documents.

[source, csharp]
----
var createProjectIndex = TestClient.GetClient().CreateIndex(c => c
	.Index<Project>()
	.AddMapping<Project>(m=>m.MapFromAttributes())
	.AddMapping<CommitActivity>(m=>m
		.SetParent<Project>()
	)
);
----
To use the child aggregation you have to make sure 
a `_parent` mapping is in place, here we create the project
index with two mapped types, `project` and `commitactivity` and 
we add a `_parent` mapping from `commitactivity` to `parent`
