# Date time providers
Not typically something you'll have to pass to the client but all calls to DateTime.Now 
in the client have been abstracted by IDateTimeProvider. This allows us to unit test timeouts and clusterfailover
in run time not being bound to wall clock time.

dates are always returned in UTC 

[source, csharp]
----
var dateTimeProvider = new DateTimeProvider();
----
[source, csharp]
----
dateTimeProvider.Now().Should().BeCloseTo(DateTime.UtcNow);
----

The default timeout calculation is: `min(*timeout* * 2 ^ (*attempts* * 0.5 -1), *maxTimeout*)`
The default values for `*timeout*` and `*maxTimeout`are

[source, csharp]
----
var timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);
----
[source, csharp]
----
var maxTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
----
Plotting these defaults looks as followed:
[timeout]
.Timeout plot

The goal here is that whenever a node is resurected and is found to still be offline we send it
back to the doghouse for an every increasingly long period untill we hit a bounded maximum.
