[[fields]]
== Fields

Quite often you don't need to waste bandwidth by returning the complete object graph foreach hit. 

Using 

[source,csharp]
----
.Fields(p=>p.Id, p=>p.Name, p=>p.Followers.First().Name, /** etc */)
----

You can limit the returned fields for each hit.

An overload taking plain strings also exists.
