[[state]]
== Cluster state

=== Get state

To get the basic cluster state, call:

[source,csharp]
----
var state = _client.ClusterState();
----

This returns a `IClusterStateResponse` that contains information about the master node, all nodes in the cluster and such.

=== Get specific part of state

If you only want a specific part, i.e. only information about nodes, you can do the following:

[source,csharp]
----
var state = _client.ClusterState(c => c
    .Metrics(ClusterStateMetric.Nodes)
);
----
