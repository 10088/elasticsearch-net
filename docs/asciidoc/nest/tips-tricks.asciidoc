=== Posting Elasticsearch queries from JavaScript

Consider a scenario where you are using client side libraries like https://github.com/fullscale/elastic.js[elasticjs]  
but want security to be provided by server side business logic. Consider this example using `WebAPI`

WARN: make sure dynamic scripting is turned off if you decide to open the full query DSL to the client!

[source,csharp]
----
[RoutePrefix("api/Search")]
public class SearchController : ApiController
{
    [ActionName("_search")]
    public IHttpActionResult Post([FromBody]SearchDescriptor<dynamic> query)
    {;
        var client = new ElasticClient();

        //Your server side security goes here

        var result = client.Search(q => query);
        return Ok(result);
    }
}
----

The fragments `[RoutePrefix("api/Search")]` and `[ActionName("_search")]` will let you change your elastic search Url 
from `http://localhost:9200/_search` to `http://yourwebsite/api/Search/_search` and let things work as normal. 
The fragment `[FromBody]SearchDescriptor<dynamic> query` will convert the JSON query into NEST SearchDescriptor. 
The fragment `client.Search(q => query)` will execute the query.
