== Search

Search is _the_ call you'll probably use the most, as it exposes Elasticsearch's key functionality: **search!**

=== Fluent DSL

[source,csharp]
----
var result = client.Search<ElasticsearchProject>(s => s
    .From(0)
    .Size(50)
    .Query(q => ....)
    .Filter(f => ....)         
);
----

=== Object Initializer Syntax

[source,csharp]
----
var searchRequest = new SearchRequest
{
    From = 0,
    Size = 50,
    Query = ...
    Filter = ...
};

var result = client.Search<ElasticsearchProject>(searchRequest);
----

=== Handling the Search response

`.Search<T>` returns an `ISearchResponse<T>` which has a `Hits` property.

`Hits` is an `IEnumerable<IHit<T>>`.  `IHit<T>` contains a `Source` property which 
holds the original document (`T`), along with other meta deta from Elasticsearch such 
as `Id`, `Score`, `Version`, `Index`, `Type`, `Sorts`, `Highlights` and `Explanation`.

See <<nest-basics, Search Basics>> section for more information.
