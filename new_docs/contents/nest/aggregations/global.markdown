# Global aggregation

## Description

Defines a single bucket of all the documents within the search execution context. This context is defined by the indices and the document types youâ€™re searching on, but is not influenced by the search query itself. For more info, read the [docs](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-global-aggregation.html).

## Usage

	var result = _client.Search<ElasticsearchProject>(s => s
				.Query(q => q
					.Match(m => m
						.OnField(f => f.Country)
						.Query("Malaysia")))
				.Aggregations(a => a
					.Global("global_bucket", descriptor => descriptor
						.Aggregations(aggr => aggr
							.Terms("bool_count", t => t
								.Field(data => data.BoolValue))))));

You can then access the result.Aggregations to get the data, i.e.

	var agg = result.Aggs.Global("global_bucket");
	var bools = agg.Terms("bool_count");
