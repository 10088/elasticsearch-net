#Sign the CLA

Contributing back to `Elasticsearch.Net` and `NEST` is very much appreciated. 
Whether you [feel the need to change one character](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-net/pull/536) or have a go at 
[mapping new API's](http://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-net/pull/376) no PR is too small or too big. 

In fact many of our most aweseome features/fixes have been provided to us by [these wonderful folks](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-net/graphs/contributors) to which we are forever indebted 

We do however ask you sign the [Elasticsearch CLA](http://www.elasticsearch.org/contributor-agreement/) before we can accept pull requests from you. 

## Coding Styleguide

Please install the [editorconfig vs extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c8bccfe2-650c-4b42-bc5c-845e21f96328)
this will automatically switch to our indentation, whitespace, newlines settings while working on our project
**while leaving your default settings intact**.

In most cases we won't shun a PR just because it uses the wrong indentation settings though it'll be **very** much appreciated!

## Tests

PR's with tests are more likely to be reviewed faster because it makes our jobs that much more easy, that being said
we respect that you are fixing a bug in your own time and might not have the time/energy to submit a PR with complete tests. 
In those cases we tend to pull your bits locally and write tests ourselves but this may mean your PR might sit idle longer then you would like.

## Git

We do not require rebased/squashed commits although we do very much appreciate it! 

Please submit your PR's to our develop branch.
